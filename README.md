### üîê **Confidential Gameplay Model**
- **On-Chain Encrypted State**: Player information (races, pending ETH, scores) is fully protected with encryption on the blockchain.
- **Confidential Actions**: Every in-game move is executed using encrypted inputs.
- **ZK Verification**: Gameplay can be validated through zero-knowledge proofs without exposing the race results.
- **Player-Controlled Decryption**: Users have full authority to decrypt and access their own data.

### üéÆ **How to Play**
- **Dino Run Gameplay** (inspired by Chrome Dinosaur Game):
  - Press Space, Up Arrow, or W to jump
  - **Avoid cactus on the ground** - jump to dodge them
  - **Score increases continuously** as you run (distance-based)
  - Stay on ground when cactus passes = HIT!
  - Speed increases over time
  - Game lasts 15 seconds with increasing difficulty
- **Game Rewards**: Score-based ETH rewards and daily leaderboard competitions
- **KMS Claim System**: Decentralized ETH claiming with Key Management Service
